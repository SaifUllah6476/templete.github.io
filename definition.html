        	<h4><b>Definition of a Sport Club</b></h4>
            	<p>A Sport Club is a group of students organized and established to promote and develop the interests and skills of members in sport related activities. The Sport Club Program is student initiated, and emphasis is placed on student leadership development, and competiveness. Sport Clubs are administered by the Sport Club Program in Recreational Sports, but are also considered student organizations and must register as a Student Organization within the Student Engagement and Leadership office located in the Martin Hall 223.</p><br>
                <h4><b>Sport Club Program Eligibility Guidelines</b></h4>
            	<p>Full feeJpaying students, faculty, staff and partJtime students are eligible to participate in the Sport Clubs Program. Only active student members are eligible to serve as appointed or elected officers for a registered Sport Club.</p><br>
                <h4><b>Sport Clubs Officer Meetings</b></h4>
            	<p>At least one officer from each sport club must attend monthly meetings with the Club Sports Coordinator or Graduate Assistant. The role of the meetings is to disseminate information from the Club Sports Coordinator and the Recreational Sports Office to the sport clubs, to share ideas among members to assist in sport club growth and development. Attendance at meetings is a part of the incentive program and will be utilized to evaluate clubs for future allocations.</p><br>
                <h4><b>Sport Clubs</b></h4>
            	<p>Clubs are ultimately responsible for making certain that each club participant of their respective club meets the minimum eligibility requirements and participant responsibilities. In addition, the entire club is responsible for making certain that all club responsibilities, policies and procedures in this manual are met and/or followed by the club as a whole and each club participant. Clubs are responsible for maintaining registration as a student organization at UL Lafayette with the Student Organization office in Martin Hall.</p><br>
                <h4><b>Sport Club Constitution</b></h4>
            	<p>Each club must maintain and review annually, the constitution under which the sport club will operate. The most recent constitution submitted is located in the Recreational Sports office. The development of a club s constitution can help the organization formulate specific guidelines that determine the directions and structure of the group. The organization s constitution is a working tool. Simplicity and flexibility are the keys to a good constitution. When writing a constitution, keep in mind immediate needs as well as future goals of your organization.</p><br>
                <h4><b>Club Participants</b></h4>
            	<p>Each club participant must always be responsible for his/her own wellJbeing and the wellJbeing of the group he/she is a part. Each club participant shares with the other club participants the responsibility of safety and agrees to follow safe procedures and to avoid unnecessary and hazardous situations. Each club participant accepts responsibility for the outcome of situations resulting when his/her actions are beyond the generally accepted practices for safety in the activity.</p><br>
